âœ¨ **GAN Image Generator** is a web application built using Streamlit that allows users to generate AI-powered images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This project leverages a pre-trained generator model to create realistic images based on random noise input.

## Features

- User-friendly interface to specify the number of images to generate.
- Displays generated images in a grid format.
- Information about Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and useful resources for further learning.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArpitKadam/GAN-Image-Generator.git
   cd GAN-Image-Generator
   ```

2. **Download the pre-trained generator model** and save it as `generator_model.keras` in the project directory. (Make sure to replace this with your actual model file.)

3. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Open your web browser** and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.

## How to Use

- Use the slider in the sidebar to select the number of images you want to generate (between 1 and 100).
- Click the "Generate Images ðŸš€" button to create the images.
- The generated images will be displayed below the button.

## About GANs

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of artificial intelligence model used to generate realistic images, videos, and even music. They work by training two neural networks â€“ a generator and a discriminator â€“ in a competitive process. The generator tries to create realistic data, while the discriminator tries to differentiate real from fake data.
